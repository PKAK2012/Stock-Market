Close Price – The final price of the stock at the end of the trading session.
Volume – The total number of shares traded during the session.
Potential Use Cases
Time Series Analysis – Analyzing stock price trends over time.
Unsupervised Learning (Clustering & Anomaly Detection) – Identifying patterns or unusual price movements.
Volatility Analysis – Studying fluctuations in stock prices.
Portfolio Optimization – Using price and volume data to improve investment strategies.

Machine Learning Approach
Since this dataset does not contain a predefined target variable, it is well-suited for unsupervised learning tasks such as:
Clustering (Grouping stocks with similar trading behaviors).
Anomaly Detection (Identifying unusual price fluctuations or trading volumes).
Dimensionality Reduction (Reducing feature complexity while preserving essential information).

Conclusion
This dataset provides valuable insights into stock market behavior and can be used for various financial analyses and machine learning applications.
